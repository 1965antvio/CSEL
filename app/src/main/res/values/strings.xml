      Who We Are \n
      Established in Padua in 1985 by a diverse group of intellectuals on the left, primarily members of the Italian Communist Party (PCI), \n
      the Centro Studi Ettore Luccini (CSEL) is dedicated to the collection, conservation, and promotion of documentary sources
      related to the history and collective memory of popular movements in the Veneto,
      specifically the working-class and union movement. \n
      We are named for a leading figure in the city’s cultural and political life in the 1950s and 1960s. \n
      We are proud to call ourselves the Historical Archive and Library of the Workers’ and Popular Movement of the Veneto,
      and to continue the mission of our founders to create a culture of democracy and solidarity. \n
      Both the Superintendent of Archives and the Region of the Veneto have officially recognized the significance of our holdings.</string>
